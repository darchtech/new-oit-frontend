              </h2>

              <p>
                The Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course at Orange ITech
                is designed to help you develop a rock-solid foundation in
                programming logic, problem-solving, and efficient coding—the
                core skills every successful software developer must have.
              </p>

              <p>
                This course takes you deep into algorithmic thinking and data
                organization, helping you understand how programs store, manage,
                and process data behind the scenes. Whether you are preparing
                for placements, competitive coding, or higher-level development
                roles, DSA is a must-have skill.
              </p>

              <p>
                With hands-on training, real-world problem solving, and live
                examples, you’ll learn how to write optimized code using the
                right data structures and algorithms for maximum performance.
